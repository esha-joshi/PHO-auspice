# [Opening dataset](https://nextstrain.org/mumps/na?d=tree)

Sidebar content (will not be displayed in mobile view)

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown

## Main display _markdown_ **content**

# [Different dataset](https://nextstrain.org/zika?d=map)

This slide defines a different dataset (`/zika`) with URL query `d=map` and thus the visualisation should change to the zika dataset and show only a map. (A quick way to check: the zika map includes south america and the pacific, whereas the mumps one is confined to North America.)
