# [Confidence](https://nextstrain.org/mumps/na?d=tree&p=full&ci)

Toggle on confidence

# [Confidence with change in tree](https://nextstrain.org/mumps/na?d=tree&p=full&ci&f_division=Washington)

Confidence should remain while we filter the tree


# [Toggle off confidence](https://nextstrain.org/mumps/na?d=tree&p=full&f_division=Washington)

Toggle off confidence (filtering doesn't change)


# [Radial tree with CIs](https://nextstrain.org/mumps/na?d=tree&p=full&ci&l=radial)

The narrative asks for CIs on a radial tree which is invalid, but shouldn't result in a non-functional app state.
